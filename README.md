# DES-Obs

## Steps to Produce the Plots:
It is advisable to run this only at the end of the observing time, as the code will split the time between first and last exposures into quartiles.
-Run "qcInvPrint" ing the godb environment as observer2.
-In a new terminal type "python psf_reader.py"

##### Arguments

So far the only argument that can be passed to this plotting code is "--show-plots=True", which will show the plots when running for 20 seconds.
